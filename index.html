    <h1>It's 2018 bruh. Why the Wii?</h1>

    <p>
      You found your way to this site, so I'm guessing you already know the glories of the Wii. Still, it bears
      stating explicitly the reasons Why the OG Wii is a console worth owning in 2018...

    <h2>The Wii is cheap.</h2>

    <p>
      You can buy a wii at a thriftshop for $20. It will usually come with a couple games or controllers thrown in.
      You can find a decent CRT TV or early flat panel television that works perfectly with the wii for literally free.
      These things can be found on craigslist, the dump, or the side of the road.

    <h2>The Wii will never be easier to get than it is now.</h2>

    <p>
      I am not one of these people that views games as an investment vehicle. Furthermore I don't believe that the
      Wii is in immediate danger of becoming a collector's item any time soon. In fact, I do
      not understand those people. I suppose they are the same types of folk who enjoy decaffinated coffee,
      and non-alchoholic beer. I WILL SAY THIS, HOWEVER, I want to own a wii, and they are no longer making them. They will
      never be MORE common than they are now. The games too, will become increasingly harder to find as time marches on. So, if
      you want a wii, now is the time to get one.
